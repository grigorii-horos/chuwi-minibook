# VBT patcher

The MiniBook X's built-in display is a 1200x1920 DSI panel. The BIOS configures
it at 50 Hz by default, which makes scrolling and animations feel noticeably
sluggish. The VBT patcher changes the panel's refresh rate by modifying the
Video BIOS Table (VBT) -- the firmware data that tells the i915 graphics driver
how to drive the panel.

The patched VBT is embedded in the initramfs and loaded at early boot via a
kernel parameter, so the change takes effect before the display is initialized.
No permanent firmware modification is involved -- removing the kernel parameter
restores the original 50 Hz behavior.

The tool source lives in `vbt_patch/`. The `update-vbt-clock` script lives in
`tools/`.

## Quick start

Build and install the tool:

```
cd vbt_patch
make
sudo make install
```

Patch to 90 Hz (see "What rate to use" if this causes artifacts):

```
sudo update-vbt-clock 90
```

This extracts the current VBT from the running kernel, patches the pixel clock
for the requested rate, installs it into the initramfs, adds the
`i915.vbt_firmware=vbt` kernel parameter, rebuilds the initramfs, and tells you
to reboot.

To revert back to 50 Hz:

```
sudo update-vbt-clock --revert
```

## Verify

After rebooting, check the active mode:

```
cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.0/i915_display_info | grep DSI -A2
```

Look for the refresh rate in the mode string. At 90 Hz it reads something like:

```
"1200x1920": 90 246394 1200 1240 1252 1268 1920 2125 2127 2159 ...
```

You can also use `xrandr` or your desktop's display settings -- the panel should
show the new refresh rate.

## What rate to use

The stock rate is 50 Hz. Try 90 Hz first -- it is a noticeable improvement in
smoothness and works on most MiniBook X units:

```
sudo update-vbt-clock 90
```

Not all units ship with the exact same panel, so 90 Hz may not work on yours. If
you see flickering, color banding, or horizontal lines after rebooting, your
panel does not support that rate -- revert and try a lower value:

```
sudo update-vbt-clock --revert
```

If the display does not come up at all after a reboot, the kernel falls back to
the BIOS VBT (50 Hz) automatically when the firmware file is missing or corrupt.
Revert from a TTY or recovery boot with `sudo update-vbt-clock --revert`.

## How it works

The i915 driver reads a VBT blob at initialization time to learn panel timings,
DSI lane configuration, power sequencing delays and rotation. Normally this
comes from the BIOS (opregion), but i915 supports loading an override from a
firmware file via the `i915.vbt_firmware` kernel parameter.

The `vbt_patch` tool parses the VBT binary, locates the Generic DTD (Block 58)
for the active panel, and modifies the pixel clock field. The refresh rate is
determined by:

```
refresh = pixel_clock / (htotal * vtotal)
```

For this panel, htotal = 1268 and vtotal = 2159 (fixed by the panel's blanking
intervals). Changing the pixel clock from ~137 MHz (50 Hz) to ~246 MHz (90 Hz)
changes the refresh rate without altering resolution or blanking.

The tool recalculates the VBT checksum after patching.

### vbt_patch usage

With no options, prints the current VBT state:

```
vbt_patch /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.0/i915_vbt
```

To patch and write a new VBT:

```
vbt_patch <input> [options] <output>
```

Options:

| Flag               | What it does                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--hz <rate>`      | Set refresh rate (calculates pixel clock automatically) |
| `--clock <kHz>`    | Set pixel clock directly                                |
| `--rotation <0-3>` | MIPI panel rotation (0=0, 1=90, 2=180, 3=270)           |
| `--panel-on <ms>`  | Panel power-on delay                                    |
| `--panel-off <ms>` | Panel power-off delay                                   |
| `--bl-on <ms>`     | Backlight enable delay                                  |
| `--bl-off <ms>`    | Backlight disable delay                                 |
| `--cycle <ms>`     | Power cycle delay                                       |

The rotation and power sequence options modify MIPI config (Block 52). They are
not needed for a refresh rate change but are available if you need to adjust
panel timing parameters.

### update-vbt-clock

The `update-vbt-clock` script automates the full workflow:

1. Reads the current VBT from `/sys/kernel/debug/dri/0000:00:02.0/i915_vbt`
1. Runs `vbt_patch --hz <rate>` to produce a patched copy
1. Installs the patched VBT to `/lib/firmware/vbt`
1. Adds `/lib/firmware/vbt` to `mkinitcpio.conf` so it is included in the
   initramfs
1. Adds `i915.vbt_firmware=vbt` to the kernel command line
1. Rebuilds the initramfs

`--revert` removes the kernel parameter. The patched VBT file remains in
`/lib/firmware/vbt` but is ignored without the kernel parameter.

The script currently supports Limine (`/etc/default/limine`) as the bootloader
and mkinitcpio for initramfs generation.
